# StudyNotes Fixes Applied - Restoring Broken Functionality

## Issues Identified and Fixed

### 1. **Modules Section Issues**

- Included `common.css` in `modules.php`

### 2. **Dashboard Recent Notes Issues**

- Preserved original `.notes-grid` layout
- Added dashboard-specific height overrides for `.note-preview`
- Included `common.css` in `dashboard.php`

### 3. **Notes Section Issues**

- Maintained legacy styling in `common.css`
- Preserved all existing functionality and interactions

### 4. **CSS Duplication Issues**
